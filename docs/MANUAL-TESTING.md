# Manual testing

Acceptance checks for the v1 alpha and the record of real-server runs.
[MASTER](MASTER.md) owns scope, decisions (D-numbers below) and order; this file
says what must work on a real server and what has been observed.

## Evidence rules

- Record the build/commit, date, operator OS/arch, server provider, OS/arch and
  topology, and the outcome. A run from a checkout is not a published-binary run.
- Use **pass**, **fail**, **blocked** (missing implementation) or **not run**.
  A skipped or absent check is never a pass.
- A submission is acceptance only. Keep the operation ID, wait for its terminal
  state, inspect serving and route state, and check the external response.
- Never store tokens, DSNs, passwords, handoff plaintext or passphrases, or
  secret values in evidence. IDs, versions, sanitized errors and response
  markers suffice.
- An existing server is not disposable. Get authorization before mutating a
  host, DNS, a database or a release.

## Developer checks

```sh
just fmt-check
go build ./...
go vet ./...
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build ./...
go -C examples/hello vet ./...
go -C examples/hello test ./...
```

Add isolated unit/regression tests for changed logic. Inspect tests before a
broad run: `just check` runs `go test ./...`, and some existing tests start
Docker fixtures. PostgreSQL integration tests need an explicit
`EREGION_TEST_DATABASE_URL` with CREATEDB and create/drop databases; never point
them at `EREGION_DATABASE_URL` or a shared database. Record them as not run unless
explicitly selected. The `postgres`, `ssh-fixture`, `transport` and `wireguard`
recipes are legacy fixtures, not the qualification policy.

## Alpha baseline — one main node

Run on an authorized fresh server (Debian 13 or Ubuntu 26.04) with a Go test app
that prints its version, a second commit of it, and a commit whose health check
fails. Install the CLI from the published edge or alpha channel.

### Server and operator

| Check | Pass means |
| --- | --- |
| Install | `install.sh` installs a signed CLI on Linux and on macOS; `upgrade` moves between two edge builds. |
| Preflight | Unsupported OS/arch, a missing credential or an unreachable host is refused before any change, with the fix. |
| Init plan | The plan names every change; declining starts nothing; `--json` without `--confirm <server>` refuses instead of prompting. |
| Init apply | Fresh server ends hardened, SSH on WireGuard only, Caddy with a valid certificate for the hostname, node_exporter reachable only over WireGuard, services ready, and the final doctor gate reports `doctor: N ok` before the handoff. A forced failing check stops before the handoff with `doctor_failed` and the fix commands; `--resume` after the fix completes without repeating earlier phases, and `--skip-doctor` ends with a warning. |
| Lockdown revert | Breaking confirmation during the SSH switchover reopens public SSH by itself; `server init --resume` completes. |
| Interrupted init | Interrupting before and after the database step and before the handoff resumes with `--resume` without lockout or duplicate identity; `--discard` drops a pending init. |
| Handoff | Plain secrets plus bundle and passphrase; init waits for "stored"; no API token in it; `--secrets-out` writes a file only when asked. |
| Login | `login` with the bundle on a second machine reaches the same server; a wrong host key fails closed; `context remove` deletes the context. |
| Atomic login | An unreachable import leaves existing context, identity and known_hosts byte-identical; an existing name requires exact `--replace NAME`; successful replacement proves readiness before swapping identity. |
| Context selection | With current context a, `--context b` and separately `EREGION_CONTEXT=b` target b for RPCs, domain/app-create DNS addresses and protected handoff identity fields; unknown names fail with the list hint. Init ready/doctor stay pinned to the initialized context even when the variable names a different server. |
| Version lockstep | A CLI newer than the node refuses with `node_version_mismatch` before any change; `apply --auto-upgrade-nodes` upgrades the node; a second `apply` is a no-op; `doctor` stays clean. |
| Dry-run version mismatch | `--dry-run --auto-upgrade-nodes` returns `node_version_mismatch` without upload/install/restart, including from macOS or a cross-architecture dev CLI; the node build stays unchanged. |
| Signed node upgrade | A published node refuses an unsigned/mismatching upload and a dev CLI; a matching signed release artifact installs. Failed manifest retrieval never falls back to checksum-only trust. |
| SSH command | `ssh --command '…'` preserves remote stdout and exit status without a PTY when piped; sudo's password refusal shows `input_required` and its fix in plain stderr or the JSON failure envelope. |
| Break-glass | `node unlock-ssh` from the provider console reopens public SSH for its window. |
| Operator tools | `server status` and `doctor` report the server's state; `eregion ssh` opens a shell over WireGuard. |
| Secrets export | `secrets export` and `secret export` need the human factor; `--yes`, `--json` and stdin cannot bypass it. |

### Application workflow

| Check | Pass means |
| --- | --- |
| App create | Guided `app create` with a private git repo, a `web` and a `worker` process, config, a secret and a domain follows the create and its first deploy to a serving card with the public URL (or a failed operation with its error); Ctrl-C detaches without cancelling and names `eregion operations follow <id>`. The flag-only form produces the same revision, and JSON returns both operation IDs without waiting. No SQL, raw JSON or manual Caddy edits. |
| Deployability | An environment missing source, domain or DNS reports exactly what is missing and refuses to deploy. |
| Domain and DNS | `domain add` shows the exact record; wrong DNS stays pending, never ready; a Cloudflare-proxied record becomes ready once the origin serves it; the certificate verifies without `-k`; a second alias and the primary both serve. |
| Alias check path | An alias added with `domain add … --check-path /users/sign-in` reaches `public=ok` while `/api/health` returns 404 on that host; the deploy public check names the host, path and status in its events. |
| Second deploy | A new commit, a changed config value and a rotated secret reach a new release; continuous requests during the switch see no failures (D17); old containers stop afterwards. |
| Failed candidate | The failing commit leaves the previous release serving and its operation failed, not rewritten. |
| Rollback | `rollback --confirm` restores the previous release with the secret revisions it used (D18); the public response matches. |
| Environment changes | `env update` and `config set` commit a new revision without deploying; the next deploy applies it; `restart` restarts the serving containers. |
| Monorepo build | Git source `context_path=apps/web` builds from that directory; missing paths and symlink escapes fail with the configured path named, never fall back to root. |
| Moved-branch retry | Submit a branch build, record its exact commit, move the branch, then retry the failed build: only the recorded commit is rebuilt. Same-key accepted replay needs no remote git access. |
| Build lifecycle | `build logs` streams a running build; `build stop` stops it; `build retry` starts a new build of the same commit. |
| Processes | `process scale web 2` runs two replicas behind Caddy; the worker runs without a port; logs show both. |
| Release command scope | A release command runs once on deploy; `process scale` and `rollback` skip the succeeded command and run no command container; changing the command runs it again on the next deploy; restart, scale and rollback refuse when its run has not succeeded. |
| Release command recovery | After a lost command response leaves the run unresolved, making the original operation terminal and deploying again recovers the completed command as succeeded without running it a second time; running, absent or unreachable original effects keep the original owner and defer. Missing/mismatched inputs hashes and status-query failures also preserve ownership and dispatch no command. |
| Leaked-container retry | A forced previous/candidate-container removal failure creates a named cleanup row visible in `env status` without failing a verified traffic switch; removing the obstruction lets maintenance remove the container and row. |
| Container repair | Removing a serving web container and restarting the worker queues one `platform.restart`, the container returns, and a second worker start with nothing missing queues no operation. A competing deploy or changed serving-deployment ID causes stale repair to skip/refuse, never restore an old release. |
| Create replay | Retrying `app create` and `env create` with the original idempotency key returns the same create and first-deploy IDs without another vault revision; without a key an existing name conflicts. |
| JSON contracts | `domain add --dry-run --json` returns one object with preview and DNS records under `data`; `logs --json` is one envelope, `--output ndjson` is the explicit streaming choice, and `--json --follow` refuses with that fix. |
| Detach and retry | Ctrl-C detaches without cancelling; `operations follow` replays; the same submission key returns the original operation; `cancel` is explicit. |
| Restart | Restarting services, the worker and Caddy keeps serving state and routes; reconciliation completes without duplicate effects. |
| Route failure | A forced Caddy reload failure shows desired, applied and failed state separately and recovers on retry; concurrent domain changes keep unrelated routes. |
| Status and logs | `app status`/`env status` show the serving release, processes, domains with DNS/route/TLS/public state and recent operations; `logs` works with no telemetry node. |
| CI | The per-environment endpoint deploys a ref with a deploy token; expired, revoked and wrong-environment tokens fail; nothing else of the API is reachable publicly. |
| Push to deploy | With auto-deploy on, a push to the bound branch deploys that commit; GitHub's redeliver creates no second deployment; a push to another branch and a wrongly signed request do nothing; after `--rotate-webhook-secret` the old secret fails. |
| Token factor | `token create` needs the TOTP code; `--yes`, `--json` and stdin cannot mint one; the secret is shown once and `token list` shows metadata only. |
| Factor-gated removal | Real `app delete`/`env delete` need exact-target confirmation and a TOTP code at a human terminal; JSON/yes/pipes cannot perform them. Direct node submission without a valid same-request factor and all real HTTP delete submissions refuse; dry-run preview stays agent-usable. |
| Removal | `domain remove`, `env delete --confirm` and `app delete --confirm` remove containers, routes and secrets per D13; other apps keep serving; operation history remains. |

## Current qualification boundary

The integrated 2026-10-28 source changes have no real-server baseline record.
Every host check above remains **not run** for this worktree; earlier andurel-site
observations cited in MASTER concern an older build, not qualification here.
PostgreSQL integration tests also remain **not run** without explicit test-target
authorization. Selected isolated tests/build/vet are developer evidence only.
During implementation, one Lane E CLI test invocation accidentally included the
excluded Docker SSH fixture; it is not authorized real-host or baseline evidence.
Final validation explicitly excludes that test.

Failed-follow acceptance: a failed deploy or failed guided first deploy returns
nonzero with the recorded error code (fallback exit 5), while retaining the
failed state/error and serving-state output. Successful follows exit 0; a remote
cancellation and Ctrl-C detach both exit 130 but have distinct messages. JSON and
NDJSON emit one failure envelope/result with operation ID and state. These checks
have isolated regressions but remain **not run** on the test server.

## Run record

Append one record per run. Do not backfill from history; runs before
2026-10-26 qualified older builds and earlier scope.
